## Introduction

Project Statement

Green Sounds is an interactive app that invites users to create music and visuals inspired by nature. Users
select from a variety of plants, each with a unique sound profile reflecting its growth and traits. For instance, a
fast-growing vine like ivy might produce vibrant, rhythmic melodies evoking energy, while a sturdy oak generates
deep, harmonious tones symbolizing strength. Delicate jasmine creates gentle, soothing sounds, while a cactus
offers sparse, calm notes that mirror its slow growth and resilience.
The app translates plant characteristics into calming soundscapes paired with soft animations of leaves unfurling
or flowers blooming. Users can mix different plant sounds to build personalized compositions, blending lively
wildflowers with tranquil lotus tones for a balanced experience.
With an intuitive interface, users can explore and experiment until they find the perfect mix. Once a
composition is complete, it can be recorded and shared as a short video featuring visuals that match the sound.
Green Sounds also serves as an educational tool, offering brief insights about each plantâ€™s traits and ecological
importance. Users learn about plant growth, habitats, and cultural significance, fostering a deeper appreciation
for nature while engaging in a creative and peaceful experience.

As a proof of concept for the application, I created a demo video with a sunflower, cactus, oak and ivy and combined their sounds at the end to produce a melody. Please view the infograph greensoundsInfoGraphic.png to learn about the educational, cognitive and gamified benefits of Green Sounds.

## Installation

To run the Green Sounds project, follow these steps:

## Code Overview

### Sunflower Growth

The sunflower grows with a smooth sway and fades out after reaching maximum growth.

```processing
void growSunflower() {
    // Implementation of sunflower growth
}

void fadeOutSunflower() {
    // Implementation of sunflower fade-out
}
```

### Cactus Growth

The cactus grows with branching structures and fades out after reaching maximum growth.

```processing
void growCactus() {
    // Implementation of cactus growth
}

void fadeOutCactus() {
    // Implementation of cactus fade-out
}
```

### Oak Tree Growth

The oak tree grows with a detailed branching structure and fades out after reaching maximum growth.

```processing
void growOakTree() {
    // Implementation of oak tree growth
}

void fadeOutOakTree() {
    // Implementation of oak tree fade-out
}
```

### Ivy Growth

The ivy grows along surfaces and fades out after reaching maximum growth.

```processing
void growIvy() {
    // Implementation of ivy growth
}

void fadeOutIvy() {
    // Implementation of ivy fade-out
}
```

## Future Improvements

Cultural Information: Incorporate cultural elements and information to enrich the user experience and provide context to the audio-visual elements.
Enhanced Interactivity: Add more interactive features to engage users and allow them to influence the audio-visual outputs in more complex ways.
Complete Application: Develop a full-fledged application with a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to a wider audience.
